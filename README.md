# loftwah-the-appsmiff
Repository for my instance of Appsmith (which I've renamed Appsmiff)

## Usage

I don't like to keep my system level stuff in these repos. I like to use a tool called Nginx Proxy Manager for my reverse proxies, but if you don't want to do that check out something like ngrok, or localtunnel.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:loftwah/loftwah-the-appsmiff.git
cd loftwah-the-appsmiff
docker-compose up -d
```
