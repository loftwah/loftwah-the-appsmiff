# loftwah-the-appsmiff
Repository for my instance of Appsmith (which I've renamed Appsmiff)

![New Project (5)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19922556/136652212-3d1677c5-21fc-42de-a1b8-f8d0b6fe8a18.png)

## Usage

I don't like to keep my system level stuff in these repos. I like to use a tool called Nginx Proxy Manager for my reverse proxies, but if you don't want to do that check out something like ngrok, or localtunnel.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:loftwah/loftwah-the-appsmiff.git
cd loftwah-the-appsmiff
docker-compose up -d
```
